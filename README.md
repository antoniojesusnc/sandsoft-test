Sandsoft Test

Make with unity 2021.3.16f1

1) The first question was interesting, but at the end was not know what is the most used and deduct the total of the string of the lines.
2) The second question about the palindrome, was curious. I took by pairs and also I identify the biggest number without a pair. 
	I see that I didnt pass all the test, I am curious about where I failed.
	
3) The thirds test was too much at the beginning, I loose some time downloading the proper Unity version. Also the project is quite empty, I would speck some of the code there.
	Regarding the level editor. I did in a fast way checking redudand tiles and in a non optimal way. I could make it better if I would have more time.
	Steps
		-I did everygthing in one file, then I split in logic and View,
		-I left the system to be able to change the items easyly. Same with the grid size.
		-After that I import the dotween animations to make easy the animations. 
			IMPORTANT: This cause me problems with the upload of the test, because the dll was not allow. So I rename the dll to ddl2. You have to rename back to dll in order to make the game works.
		I did a main scene and a logo generated by AI to show in the main screen
		
Hope you find the test well and thank you for this opportunity. 
Have a great weekend.
Best,
Antonio.


PS: I feel that a test of 8 hours in a row is too much, because I feel that I cannot stop once I begin. I would split in two test, maybe 2 hours ( 1 per question ) and 6 hours for the unity project.
